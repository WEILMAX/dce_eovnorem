This paper extensively reviews operational modal analysis approaches and related system identiﬁcation methods. First, the mathematical models employed in identiﬁcation are related to the equations of motion, and their modal structure is revealed. Then, strategies that are common to the vast majority of identiﬁcation algorithms are discussed before detailing some powerful algorithms. The extraction and validation of modal parameter estimates and their uncertainties from the identiﬁed system models is discussed as well. Finally, different modal analysis approaches and algorithms are compared in an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study.},

abstract = {The use of natural frequency as a diagnostic parameter in structural assessment procedures using vibration monitoring is discussed in the paper. The approach is based on the fact that natural frequencies are sensitive indicators of structural integrity. Thus, an analysis of periodical frequency measurements can be used to monitor structural condition. Since frequency measurements can be cheaply acquired, the approach could provide an inexpensive structural assessment technique. The relationships between frequency changes and structural damage are discussed. Various methods proposed for detecting damage using natural frequencies are reviewed. Factors which could limit successful application of vibration monitoring to damage detection and structural assessment are also discussed.}

ABSTRACT = {Structural damages occur in modern structures during operations due to environmental and human factors. The damages accumulating with time may lead to a significant decrease in structure performance or even destruction; natural symmetry is broken, resulting in an unexpected life and economic loss. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the structural response to detect the damage in an early stage, evaluate the health condition of structures, and ensure the operation safety of structures. In fact, the structure and the evaluation can be considered as a special symmetry. Among several SHM methods, vibration-based SHM techniques have been widely adopted recently. Hence, this paper reviews the vibration-based SHM methods in terms of the vibrational parameters used. In addition, the technical codes on vibration based SHM system have also been reviewed, since they are more important in engineering applications. Several related ISO standards and national codes have been developed and implemented, while more specific technical codes are still required to provide more detailed guidelines in practice to maintain structure safety and natural symmetry.},

sources and temperature effects},
journal = {Smart Materials and Structures},
abstract = {This paper discusses two very relevant practical issues in the application of vibration-based health monitoring to civil engineering structures: the excitation source and the effect of temperature. The idea of vibration-based damage detection is to measure dynamic characteristics such as eigenfrequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes on a regular basis. The state, and eventually degradation, of the structure is reflected in the evolution of these characteristics. Unfortunately, it is not only the health of a structure that influences its measurable dynamics, but also the applied excitation and the changing temperature are important factors and may erode the damage detection potential. In the first part, the results of different excitation types are compared: band-limited noise generated by shakers, an impact from a drop weight and ambient sources such as wind and traffic. In the second part, the undeniable effect of temperature on measured eigenfrequencies is demonstrated and a methodology is proposed to distinguish these temperature effects from real damage events. The method could be validated on a unique data set from a bridge that was artificially damaged after a one-year monitoring period.}
